# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
        - It seems like it might be useful to use `if` statements on a large chunk of integers, or strings to figure out certain qualities or conditions met without having to go through the entire list yourself. That's probably just one way.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
        - I could use some practice creating the each statements. I was having trouble getting the correct syntax for interpolation. Its seems like the  hashtag and curly brackets in interpolation are just need if a variable is inside a string and not if it's on its own. 
        As in `word.length`
        vs `"The length of #{word} is #{word.length}"`
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?
        - I'm getting better at making mistakes and pushing through, taking a breath, and revisiting the issue. It has resulted in me learning more and teaching myself some resilience in the process
        - I have also accidentally neglected to commit separate updates to this file and to my each.rb file. Good to remember that! Looks like it'll be one  big commit for each.rb and one commit for self-evaluation.md
